# CHATTER

### In this age of pictures, hashtags, Reels and Tiktoks, likes and comments, a traditional bookwormâ€™s heaven would be a blog to get access to more text-based content.

### Chatter aims to be that heaven specifically for this kind of audience. A multi-functional platform where authors and readers can create and have access to their own content. 

### Chatter aims to knock off competition from the likes of Hashnode and Medium in its first 2 years of launch.
